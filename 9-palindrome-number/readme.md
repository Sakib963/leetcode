## ðŸ§  Thinking Process 
If the reverse of a string is the same as original one then the string is called palindrome, right?! so here in this problem i have to check if the `number` is palindromic or not! so my first idea was to converting the number to string, then reversing that string. After reversing converting it again to a number, then check whether it matched with original one!
