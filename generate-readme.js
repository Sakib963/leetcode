This repo is where I document the LeetCode problems I‚Äôve solved using JavaScript.

Each problem has its own folder with:
- the solution file
- (maybe!) a short \`readme.md\` where I explain how I thought about the problem, what tripped me up, and what I learned from it

The goal isn‚Äôt just to get the right answer ‚Äî it‚Äôs to get better at thinking clearly, breaking down problems, and writing good code under pressure.

I‚Äôm not trying to rush through hundreds of problems. I just want to build a solid habit of consistent practice and reflection.

Thanks for stopping by ‚úåÔ∏è
