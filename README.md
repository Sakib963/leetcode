# leetcode

This repo is where I document the LeetCode problems I’ve solved using JavaScript.

Each problem has its own folder with:
- the solution file
- (maybe!) a short `readme.md` where I explain how I thought about the problem, what tripped me up, and what I learned from it

The goal isn’t just to get the right answer — it’s to get better at thinking clearly, breaking down problems, and writing good code under pressure.

I’m not trying to rush through hundreds of problems. I just want to build a solid habit of consistent practice and reflection.

Thanks for stopping by ✌️
